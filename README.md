Doing Without Eclipse
If you want to use something else to create your web documents and programs for the course, you are welcome to do so. On Windows, people often use Notepad or Notepad++ and just save related files in a common folder. On Macs, you can use Apple's development tools (XCode), which would be massive overkill for this course, or a text editor like TextEdit (which comes with the system), TextWrangler, BBEdit, vim, or even emacs. On Linux, you'd probably be using vim or emacs if you're not using Eclipse.
Whatever you choose (including Eclipse), you need to be able to create and edit your files, load them into your browser to view them, and ultimately upload them to BlackBoard. None of these steps require Eclipse. But if you want to use Eclipse, read on for some suggestions. And even if you're not planning to use Eclipse, please see the Important Note About Backups at the end of this document.
Setting up Eclipse for Web development
1.	Under the "Help" menu, select the "Install New Software..." item.
2.	Next to the menu labeled "Work with:", click the "Add" button to add a new software repository.
3.	In "Work with", paste: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/kepler
4.	In "Web, XML, Java EE and OSGi Enterprise Development", check:
1.	Eclipse Java EE Developer Tools
2.	Eclipse Java Web Developer Tools
3.	Eclipse Web Developer Tools
4.	Eclipse XML Editors and Tools
Finally, click "Next" to install the new software and "Dynamic Web Project" will be available.
